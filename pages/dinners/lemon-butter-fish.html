<header><h1>Lemon butter fish
</h1></header>
<ul><li>5 servings</li></ul>

<h2>Ingredients:</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>4 good-sized firm white fish fillets, about 6 inches long, 1-inch thickness (cod, halibut, or mahi would work well.)</li>
		<li>3 TB melted butter (I use salted, but unsalted is fine)</li>
		<li>Juice and zest from 1 medium lemon</li>
		<li><sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> tsp kosher salt, plus extra to taste</li>
		<li>1 tsp paprika</li>
		<li>1 tsp garlic powder</li>    
		<li>1 tsp onion powder</li>
		<li>1/4 tsp freshly ground black pepper</li>
		<li>3 TB olive oil</li>
		<li>freshly chopped basil or parsley leaves, for garnish and flavor</li>
		<li>extra lemon slices for serving</li>

	</ul>


	<h2>Instructions:</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>Use paper towels to thoroughly pat-dry excess moisture from fish fillets – this step is crucial for fish to brown nicely in pan. Set aside.</li>
		<li>In a bowl, combine melted butter, lemon juice and zest, and 1/2 tsp kosher salt. Stir to combine well. Taste and add a bit more kosher salt, if desired.</li>
		<li>In a separate bowl, combine the remaining 1/2 tsp kosher salt, paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, and black pepper. Evenly press spice mixture onto all sides of fish fillets.</li>
		<li>In a large, heavy pan over medium high heat, heat up the olive oil until hot. Once your oil is sizzling,  Cook 2 fish fillets at a time to avoid overcrowding (allows for even browning.) Cook each side just until fish becomes opaque, feels somewhat firm in the center, and is browned – lightly drizzle some of the lemon butter sauce as you cook, reserving the rest for serving. Take care not to over-cook, as that will result in a tougher texture. Season with extra kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste.</li>
		<li>Serve fish with with remaining lemon butter sauce, basil or parsley, and lemon wedges.</li>
